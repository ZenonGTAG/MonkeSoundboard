# MonkeSoundboard
A Gorilla Tag Mod that lets you play sounds through your microphone [MODDED LOBBIES ONLY]

# HOW TO USE

Launch Gorilla Tag with the mod, then you should see a folder in the BepInEx folder (NOT PLUGINS) that is called "MonkeSoundboard". In here, you want to drag in .wav and .ogg files of your choice. Once you have got your sounds, restart Gorilla Tag and join a modded lobby.

Once you're in a modded, you should see a GUI at the top left of your screen. It has all the names of the sounds that you put in, you can press on that sound to play it. If you want to stop the sound, press Stop/Fix Mic.

Once the sound is done playing, you need to press Stop/Fix Mic. (will be changed in later update)
